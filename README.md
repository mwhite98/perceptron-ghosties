# perceptron-art
Project for COGS 300.
This project is built using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and based off of Daniel Shiffman's ["The Nature of Code"](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/).

### Running Locally
- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed onto your computer.
- Do new work on your own branch!
- To make sure you have everything installed locally that this project uses, run:
```
npm i
(Also if you don't have brower-sync:
npm install -g browser-sync)
```
- To run this project / develop locally:
```
browser-sync start --server -f -w
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
```
- Tap the screen to allow mic input, and then make noise to watch what happens!

### Project TODOs
- [x] Figure out tech stack / base code
- [ ] Determine what the Perceptron should 'learn'
    - What do the weights need to be moving to? What is the end goal?
- [ ] Draw up some visuals so we know what to work towards / what we want it to look like
- [ ] Figure out how to better integrate perceptron algorithm with output visuals
- [ ] Experiment on own branches to see what sorts of visuals we can all come up with!
- [ ] The poster
- [ ] The final video
