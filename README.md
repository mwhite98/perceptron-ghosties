# perceptron-ghosties
Project for COGS 300.
This project is built using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and based off of Daniel Shiffman's ["The Nature of Code"](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/).

A single-layer perceptron that learns to navigate a platform game. Also stands as an exploration into Rodney Brook's [Subsumption Architecture](https://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/AIM-864.pdf).
